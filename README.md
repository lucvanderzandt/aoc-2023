## About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, and more. You don't need a computer science background to participateâ€”just a little programming knowledge and some problem-solving skills will get you a long way.
